# Networking Basics

This project covers fundamental concepts in computer networking, including the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP/UDP protocols, and network troubleshooting tools.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain the OSI model and its layers
- Understand different types of networks, including LAN, WAN, and the Internet
- Describe MAC and IP addresses and their roles in networking
- Differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols
- Identify commonly used TCP/UDP ports
- Utilize network troubleshooting tools such as ping/ICMP

## Tasks Overview

### 0. OSI model

This task introduces the OSI model and its layers, focusing on the Transport and Network layers.

### 1. Types of network

Learn about different types of networks, including LAN, WAN, and Internet, and their typical usage scenarios.

### 2. MAC and IP address

Understand MAC and IP addresses, which are essential identifiers for network devices.

### 3. UDP and TCP

Differentiate between UDP and TCP protocols, which operate at the Transport layer of the OSI model.

### 4. TCP and UDP ports

Explore TCP and UDP ports, which facilitate communication between network devices.

### 5. Is the host on the network

Learn how to use the ping command, which utilizes ICMP to check the availability of network devices.
